MyToken Smart Contract
Version: 0.8.18

License: MIT

This is a basic example of a Solidity smart contract that implements a simple token called "MyToken" (with the name "META" and abbreviation "MTA"). The contract allows for minting and burning tokens, as well as tracking balances of token holders.

Public Variables
tokenName: The name of the token ("META").
tokenAbbrv: The abbreviation of the token ("MTA").
totalSupply: The total supply of the token, initialized to 0.
Mapping
The contract uses a mapping to keep track of token balances for each address:

balances: A mapping that associates addresses with their token balances.
Functions
mint(address _address, uint _value): This function allows the contract owner to mint (create) new tokens and assign them to a specific address. It increases the total supply and the balance of the target address by the specified value.

burn(address _address, uint _value): This function allows the contract owner to burn (destroy) tokens held by a specific address. It decreases the total supply and the balance of the target address by the specified value, but only if the target address holds enough tokens to burn.

Usage
To use this smart contract, you can deploy it on a compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) such as Ethereum mainnet, a testnet, or a local development environment. After deployment, you can interact with the contract using Ethereum wallet software or web3 libraries.

Deployment: Deploy the contract to an EVM-compatible network using Solidity compiler version 0.8.18.

Interacting: Use a web3-enabled interface (like Remix, Truffle, or your custom dApp) to call the mint and burn functions. The mint function allows you to create new tokens, while the burn function lets you destroy existing tokens.

Important Considerations
This is a minimalistic example for educational purposes and lacks several important features present in production-ready token contracts (e.g., access control, events, additional functions).

Always make sure to thoroughly test your smart contracts, especially when dealing with real assets on the blockchain.

Consider security best practices and follow the latest recommendations from the Solidity team and the Ethereum community.
